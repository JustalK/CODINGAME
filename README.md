## Description

This repository is a compilation of my games on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/). When I have some free time, I like to play on this website. I particularly affectionnate the clash of code. It's fast and quite interesting for improving my knowledge on the function of my favorites languages whatever is JavaScript or Python.

I also participate quite often in the Bot competition, I am not that good but I am making progress slowly and slowly. Most of the time, the bots are using algorithm that I am not using in my daily work. So it's a nice way to learn new algorithms.

Finally, I love the Code Golf. It's completely useless in a professional work environment. But it's funny to see how short we can write code. I am nicely ranked in this category since I know all the shortcut of JavaScript.
